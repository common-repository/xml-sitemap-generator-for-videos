= Can I block search engines from indexing pages that are in the XML Sitemap file? =

The Sitemaps protocol enables you to let search engines know what content you would like indexed. To tell search engines the content you don't want indexed, use a robots.txt file or add a robots meta tag to the web page that you would like to block.
